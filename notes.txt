-- About the Band Connect app --

As mentioned in the README.md file for this repository, the primary purpose of this project at this time is to get practice building a single page application using React.js.

The two main types of Services/Activities that a user can engage in are:
	- Find a band to play with
	- Find a member for your band

There may be more types of services added later, such as postings for...

	- spaces available to practice music
	- music lessons
	- musical instruments for sale

	... but for now the app will focus on the first two listed above.

Initial pages/screens of the app:

- Sign Up / Log In
- Log In
- Sign Up
- Welcome
- Musician profile (regular and edit view)
	- Profile pic
	- General bio
	- Genres of music musician is interested in playing
	- Music career goals or just for fun
		- When setting up a profile, a user/musician will be asked to rate on a scale from 1 to 5 how serious they are about having a career in the music industry, with 1 being not looking for a music career at all and 5 being very serious.
		  The ratings may be described similar to the following:
		  1) Just want to play music for fun, and maybe get a jam band started.
		  2) Definitely would like to get a jam band started, but probably not interested in playing music as a career.
		  3) Definitely want to get a band started.  Could just be in a jam band and be happy; but having a career making music sounds great too!
		  4) I am definitely serious in my music and would love to make a career of it.  I could play in a jam band and have fun, but I'd prefer to play with musicians who are looking for a career playing music as well.
		  5) I am looking to make a career out of playing music, and I am only looking to connect with band members who are looking for the same.
