-- About the Band Connect app --

As mentioned in the README.md file for this repository, the primary purpose of this project at this time is to get practice building a single page application using React.js.

The two main types of Services/Activities that a user can engage in are:
	- Find a band to play with
	- Find a member for your band

There may be more types of services added later, such as postings for...

	- spaces available to practice music
	- music lessons
	- musical instruments for sale

	... but for now the app will focus on the first two listed above.

Initial pages/screens of the app:

- Sign Up / Log In
- Search for a band or band member
	- Modal or section opens up to enter/select search details and filters
- Search Results
- Messages section
	- List view of numerous message threads
	- Thread Detail view
	- Create new message modal
- Musician profile (regular and edit view)
- Band profile (regular and edit view)
